## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   BEM naming convention

### What I learned

This was a fairly simple project to complete. One part of it that required some research was the toggle switch in the header of the page. I had not used even simple animations before so I had to look up information about them.

This project was also a goob practice for using pseudo-elements.

### Continued development

I did not try to complete my solution without JS. I can see how it can be done and might return to the challenge later.
